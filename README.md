The live version of projet you can see [here.](https://vkirijanova.github.io/Milestone-project-1/)

# UX #

The aim of project is to create website that would be fully responsive on all devices and screens. Users range would 
vary from 18 to 50 years old, so website must be easy to use, without extra information, catch customer eyes 
on amazing and tasty food, followed by simple and clear food menu.

## User Stories: ##
1. As a user, I want to see pictures of food, to know what I will receive.
2. As a user, I want to see a full food menu with a price list, to know if this place meets my budget.
3. As a user, I want to know the location of the place, to know if it far from my home.
4. As a user, I want to know opening hours, to know when I can come.

# Features #

### Existing features ###
1. Collapse navigation bar helps returning customers to scroll down to the menu or delivery section without scrollong down.
2. Carousel of pictures catches the attention of first-time customers and makes them hungry.

### Future features ###
1. To add first guest's feedback as soon as the restaurant will become more popular.
2. Order online system will help customers to order faster and no need to use a second party website.

***
The style and colors of the project have been taken as the initial idea of restaurant owners. The layout of the project 
been focused on food pictures to catch users attention to the new start-up restaurant. 
Followed by a food menu, for customers to realize if it fits their budget and ending with location, 
opening hours and delivery options if the restaurant will meet all their preferences.

# Technology used #
- HTML 
- CSS (the language to style HTML and make bootstrap more individual)
- Bootstrap (carousel, burger button and grid container)
- Balsamic framework (page layot)
- Font Awesome
- W3C school
- W3C mark up validation service (to test HTML and CSS)

# Testing #
- HTML and CSS have been tested with W3C mark up validation service and both have been successfully passed.
- Live project's responsiveness passed through the Google Developer tool.
- Project's responsiveness has been also manually checked on iPhone, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge.
- Feedback has been asked from friends, who interacted with the live project manually.

## Testing user stories ##
- As a user, I want to see pictures of food, to know what I will receive. 

    Website main page is the carousel of food pictures, the user will straight land on desirable food.

- As a user, I want to see a full food menu with a price list, to know if this place meets my budget.

    User can scroll down or use the drop-down navigation bar to move straight to food menu with prices and full dish description.

- As a user, I want to know the location of the place, to know if it far from my home.

    User can scroll down or use a drop-down navigation bar to move straight to restaurant location. Where user will see a full restaurant's address with postcode.

- As a user, I want to know opening hours, to know when I can come.

    User can scroll down or use a drop-down navigation bar to move straight to location row. Where user can see the opening hours of a restaurant with a specific day of the week.

### Issues ###
- Background picture in the location container needed to be removed as users couldn't see text with information.
- Same effect happened with text over pictures carousel. I move text under carousel that users focused more on pictures before 
heading to the story of the restaurant.
-Navigation bar's dropdown was not working on the top of the carousel. Z index has been raised to fix this issue.
